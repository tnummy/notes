# Notes

## About 
This is just a simple note app.


## Demo
[Live Demo](http://notes.timnummy.com/) 

Demo email: *test@account.com* 

Demo password: *password*

## Download and run locally

**Prerequisites** 

Standard Laravel Requirements... PHP, Composer, etc.

**Download**

`git clone... yada yada`

**Database** 

Update this line with the correct path

>/absolute/path/to/notes/database/database.sqlite

This is set up using Sqlite for test storage, the database can be changed in .env

To reset database, use:
 
 `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

**Running** 

Run locally with:

`php artisan serve`

## Other Thoughts

This repo is a little bloated with files usually not committed such as .env, /vendor, and database.sqlite. This is because I can't use composer where the demo is hosted so I had to ship all the dependencies to "production" from local development. Furthermore, Sqlite is quick and easy for development... and for a demo, so the environment variables ended up being the same (with the exception of the absolute path to the database file) - in a real application, something more robust is probably preferred. That said, this repo should include everything needed to run this application as-is.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
